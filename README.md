 <h2>1. Introduction</h2> 
The Chess Game Project is a web-based chess game developed using React JS. This documentation aims to provide an overview of the project, its key features, installation instructions, usage guidelines, challenges faced during development, future enhancements, and a concluding note.

<h2>2. Technologies Used</h2>
The Chess Game Project leverages the following technologies and frameworks:

HTML/CSS: The standard markup language and styling for web pages. </br>
JavaScript: The programming language used for implementing the game logic and interactions.</br>
React JS: A JavaScript library used for building user interfaces.</br>
Redux: A state management system for React JS applications.</br>

<h2>3. Features</h2> 
The Chess Game Project boasts the following features:

<h4>Chess Game Logic:</h4> The game implements the complete set of rules and logic for chess, including movement, capturing, checkmate, and draw conditions.</br>
<h4>Checkmate Detection:</h4> The game detects when the king is in checkmate, signaling the end of the game and declaring a winner.</br>
<h4>Tactical Moves:</h4> Players can employ various tactical moves, such as pinning a piece to the king, to strategically outmaneuver their opponents.</br>
<h4>Castling:</h4> Both short and long castling moves are supported, enabling players to fortify their king's position and develop a solid defense.</br>
<h4>Pawn Promotion:</h4> The game allows pawn promotion, enabling pawns to be promoted to higher-value pieces when reaching the opposite end of the board.</br>
<h2>4. Installation</h2> 
To run the Chess Game Project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the project repository from [insert repository URL].
Install the required dependencies by running the following command: npm install.
Start the development server using: npm start.
Open your web browser and access the game at http://localhost:3000 (or the specified port, if different).
5. Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Once the game is running, users can:

Interact with the chessboard by clicking on pieces and valid squares.
