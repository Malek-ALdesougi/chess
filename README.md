 <h2>1. Introduction</h2> 
The Chess Game Project is a web-based chess game developed using React JS. This documentation aims to provide an overview of the project, its key features, installation instructions, usage guidelines, challenges faced during development, future enhancements, and a concluding note.

<h2>2. Technologies Used</h2>
The Chess Game Project leverages the following technologies and frameworks:

- HTML/CSS: The standard markup language and styling for web pages. </br>
- JavaScript: The programming language used for implementing the game logic and interactions.</br>
- React JS: A JavaScript library used for building user interfaces.</br>
- Redux: A state management system for React JS applications.</br>

<h2>3. Features</h2> 
The Chess Game Project boasts the following features:

- <h4>Chess Game Logic:</h4> The game implements the complete set of rules and logic for chess, including movement, capturing, checkmate, and draw conditions.</br>
- <h4>Checkmate Detection:</h4> The game detects when the king is in checkmate, signaling the end of the game and declaring a winner.</br>
- <h4>Tactical Moves:</h4> Players can employ various tactical moves, such as pinning a piece to the king, to strategically outmaneuver their opponents.</br>
- <h4>Castling:</h4> Both short and long castling moves are supported, enabling players to fortify their king's position and develop a solid defense.</br>
- <h4>Pawn Promotion:</h4> The game allows pawn promotion, enabling pawns to be promoted to higher-value pieces when reaching the opposite end of the board.</br>
<h2>4. Installation</h2> 
To run the Chess Game Project locally, follow these steps:

- Clone the project repository from https://github.com/Malek-ALdesougi/chess.</br>
- Install the required dependencies by running the following command: npm install.</br>
- Start the development server using: npm start. </br>
- Open your web browser and access the game at http://localhost:3000.</br>

<h2>5. Usage</h2>
Once the game is running, users can:

- Two users must play on the same device (No socket io added yet). </br>
- Interact with the chessboard by clicking on the pieces and valid squares.</br>
- Move the pieces according to the rules of chess, first click on the piece is to select a piece and the second click is to choose a new position for the piece.</br
- Observe the game state, including check, and checkmate.</br>
-  Utilize tactical moves, castling, and pawn promotion to their advantage.</br>
- Play against another human player only and on the same device as mentioned before.</br>

<h2>7. Future Enhancements </h2>
To enhance the Chess Game Project in the future, the following improvements are planned:

- Online Multiplayer: Integrate Socket.io or similar technology to allow players to engage in online multiplayer matches. This feature would enable users to play against each other remotely, adding a competitive and social aspect to the game.
- AI Opponent: Implement an AI opponent using algorithms such as Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning or Monte Carlo Tree Search. This would provide players with the option to play against the computer at different difficulty levels, enhancing the game's single-player experience.


<h2>8. Conclusion</h2>
The Chess Game Project showcases a complete chess game implemented from scratch using React JS. It incorporates essential chess features, including game logic, checkmate detection, tactical moves, castling, and pawn promotion. By providing this documentation, we hope to inspire and assist others in exploring the world of chess game development.

Thank you for your interest in the Chess Game Project, and we look forward to further enhancing the game in the future!
